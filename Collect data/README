This code is an update of Richard's code (https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/MPU6050-Pi-Demo) which in turn is a modification of Jeff Rowberg's code so that the library works on the Raspberry Pi.

"I have simply hacked it to work with the RaspberryPi, using the in-kernel
I2C drivers. It should be trivial to make use of any of the other sensors
Jeff supports in this way." - Richard Hirst <richardghirst@gmail.com>   06 Nov 2012

You need libgtkmm-3.0-dev installed in order to build.
You need wiring-pi installed in order to build collect_data.
    http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/


NOTE: If you have a revision 2 Raspberry Pi you need to edit I2Cdev.cpp
      and change all references to "/dev/i2c-0" to read "/dev/i2c-1".

'make' will create two archives:

collect_data - save MPU data in the "Datas" folder.
IMU_zero - collect offsets to MPU.

# Hardware #

GPIO 8(SDA),9(SCL) - sensor MPU6050
GPIO 0 - green led
GPIO 2 - red led
GPIO 3 - push button
